# Final_project
## Here are the specific requirements:

Find a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing.
Use machine learning (ML) with the technologies we’ve learned.
You must use Scikit-learn and/or another machine learning library.
Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.
You must use at least two of the following:
Python Pandas
Python Matplotlib
HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
JavaScript Plotly
JavaScript Leaflet
SQL Database
MongoDB Database
Google Cloud SQL
Amazon AWS
Tableau

Data analysis
Data in the form of columns:
* Store - the store number (1-45)
* Date - the week of sales (2010,2011,2012)
* Weekly_Sales - sales for the given store
* Holiday_Flag - whether the week is a special holiday week (1 – Holiday week and 0 – Non-holiday week)
* Temperature - Temperature on the day of sale
* Fuel_Price - Cost of fuel in the region
* CPI – Prevailing consumer price index
* Unemployment - Prevailing unemployment rate
